This thesis describes a study of organizational collaboration in Apache Software Foundation open source software projects during the period between January 1, 2016 and June 1, 2016, using social networks for modeling the collaboration. The social networks are built by first identifying the employers of individual project contributors, and then creating a graph where vertices represent organizations and edges represent collaborations, as defined by Git and JIRA contributions by the linked organizations' employees to common projects. The network is then analyzed by calculating organizational centralities, and the centralization of the network. The communities of the network are plotted in order to reveal the different clusters of organizations comprising it, which are then investigated in more detail.

It is demonstrated that organizational collaboration in Apache Software Foundation is moderately centralized, and that there is a prominent central cluster of organizations working on projects related to distributed computing. It is shown that organizations with high centralities are typically either significant actors in this central cluster, or serve as ``bridges'' between clusters. These findings contribute to a macroscopic understanding of organizational collaboration in Apache Software Foundation.
