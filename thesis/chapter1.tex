\chapter{Introduction}
The time period \timeperiod{} under observation began at January 1, 2016 and ended at June 1, 2016. This period was chosen for two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A six-month period reduced the possibility of contributors having changed employers during the period, which would have introduced problems in cleanly associating their contributions with individual organizations.
	\item Since the LinkedIn employer data was collected in June 2016, having the period end at that time preserved the timeliness (and thus relevance) of that data.
\end{itemize}
