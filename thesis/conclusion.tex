\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis presented several findings about how organizations contribute to Apache Software Foundation projects. A social network was used to model the collaborations between organizations, allowing both visual and mathematical analysis of the structure of the ASF from an organizational perspective. The network was found to be moderately centralized, with a central cluster of Hadoop related collaboration being one of the main features of the network. It was also shown that a few organizations achieved high centrality not by existing in the central cluster, but by connecting multiple disparate clusters.
